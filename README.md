# ANN_EMPLOLYEE_ATTRITION


# 🧠 Employee Attrition Prediction using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

## 📌 Project Overview
Employee attrition is a major challenge for organizations as it leads to increased recruitment costs, loss of experienced employees, and reduced productivity.  
This project uses **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** to predict whether an employee is likely to leave the organization based on historical HR data.

The goal is to help HR teams make **data-driven and proactive retention decisions**.

---

## 🚀 Problem Statement
Organizations struggle to identify employees who are at risk of leaving. Traditional HR analysis methods are manual, reactive, and inefficient.

**Objective:**  
Build a machine learning model that accurately predicts employee attrition using employee demographic, job, and performance-related data.
